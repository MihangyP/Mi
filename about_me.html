					Hello, my name is <strong>Mihangy Pierrot</strong>. I’m currently studying Computer Science at <strong>42 Antananarivo</strong>. I don’t have a particular specialization yet—I’m exploring a bit of everything. If I were to describe myself, I'd simply say I’m a <strong>programmer</strong>, meaning someone who creates computer programs, no matter the type.
				</p>
				<p>
				My passion for this field began back in high school, in my sophomore year, when my dad bought our first desktop computer. Naturally curious, I wanted to display a black screen with green text like in the movies. With the help of YouTube tutorials, I managed to do it, and I was hooked, even though I barely understood what I was doing at first.
				</p>
				<p>
					After high school, I couldn’t immediately pursue computer science due to financial constraints. Instead, I went into a public university, studying Economics. In my second year, I took a web development course through <strong>SAYNA</strong>, funded by the <strong>International Organization of La Francophonie</strong>. There, I learned to create websites using <strong>HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, and SQL</strong>.
				</p>
				<p>
				After that course, I trained myself in React and React Native. About a year later, I decided to leave Economics and joined 42 Antananarivo. This is where I truly learned to program.
				</p>
				<p>
					If I had to name the programming language I’m most proficient in, I’d say there’s just one for now: <strong>C</strong>.
